# Algorithms

My Algorithm University crashed, so I am rebooting the repo with humbler goals. In here, I will try to work on algorithms and mostly experiments. 

# Test Data

I have located resources for test data that can be used for testing and designing algorithms. Mostly, they are for machine learning research and data science, but they can work as data for any algorithm. I like to think about algorithms everyday, and try to implement some code although my implementations are mostly meant to be interpreted as pseudo-codes as I am just not very good anymore at coding like I used to be.

I have been thinking about trees. Mostly, why are they useful. Well, the idea is to implement them and experiment with different data, for developing ideas for further research and study. I want to keep to a modular approach, so everything will be a single unit and I will add the details to it over time. It is how I program now, it is an evolutionary process.

I have three books I study. I invite you to pick them up and give them a read:
1) Foundations of Computer Science, C Edition
2) Structure and Interpretation of Programs
3) The Handbook of Algorithms and Data Structures

I implement mostly in Python and C. I would gladly program in C++, if you can accept that I still use C++98. I also will program in Pascal, because I think Free Pascal is under rated.

# Python

* Modular Algorithms and Data Structures
* Experimental Algorithm Design
* Swig and C/C++
* Cython and Nuitka

# Scheme

Getting pumped up, it is a different paradigm of computing. It is the Lambda calculus, which is something I don't know much about it. It is much too diffiult to understand, but the ideas are phenomonal to think about. I get pumped up thinking about all these maths and codes brilliant minds have created and then I am all pumped up to do theory.
