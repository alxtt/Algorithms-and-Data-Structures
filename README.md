# Algorithms

My Algorithm University crashed, so I am rebooting the repo with humbler goals. In here, I will try to work on algorithms and mostly experiments. 

# Test Data

I have located resources for test data that can be used for testing and designing algorithms. Mostly, they are for machine learning research and data science, but they can work as data for any algorithm. I like to think about algorithms everyday, and try to implement some code although my implementations are mostly meant to be interpreted as pseudo-codes as I am just not very good anymore at coding like I used to be.
