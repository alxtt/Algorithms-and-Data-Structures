# MPI-Algorithms
Implementation of a few algorithms using MPI. Developed as coursework for Parallel Algorithms course @ PUC Minas.

**Message Passing Interface (MPI)** is a standardized and portable message-passing standard designed by a group of researchers from academia and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures. In this project I have implemented a few algorithms under the MPI pattern using the standard C library *mpi.h* .
