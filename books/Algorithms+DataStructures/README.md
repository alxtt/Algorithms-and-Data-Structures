# Algorithms, Logics, and Codes

It is the fundamental study of what is computable and what isn't. It is the artificial life in the electronic circuits calculting every nano-second the software that runs the computer system. Billions of switches that form patterns that are abstracted from the position of electrons moving through electronic circuits. It is the physics of computing hardware and software for everyone.

I am a scientist. I study computers. I guess I am a computer scientist, but that is debatable. If you use a computer, you will need to know things that do this and things that do that. If you have a natural curiosity, and like Science, you can approach it as elementary computer science. And that is what it is, elementary. So I am an elementary computer scientist, as I study the fundamental algorithms of computations.

There are three goals to emphasize:

  1) To consider the maths and logics of algorithms
  2) To implement and study the algorithm
  3) Practical and Theoretical values and virtues

# Grammar, Logics and Programs

Now, we can begin to think about algorithms as languages we create to talk about them. We will need a grammar to create languages to talk about mathematical theories of algorithms and data structures. With the EBNF grammar, we can construct the formal language in which we can design programs and logics as mathematical process with our algorithms. For this, I recommend to read the Handbook of Algorithms and Data Structures which gives some guide on how this grammar is defined. We will then build compilers and interpreters, so that we can write programs and talk about the things we can do with the algorithm with the grammar. When we program it into a computer, we are incredibly fortunate that people have already done the hard work of making computer languages and compilers for us. We just need to learn the language we want to use, and use it. But! You do not need a computer to design and process algorithms at all.

# Test Data

For implementing and testing algorithms, you will need some kind of data. Forunately, there are lots of databases available. Most of it is meant for machine learning research, but we can use it for developing and testing any kind of algorithms too. Here are some sites you can find databases you can use for with your algorithms:
